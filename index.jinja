<p>Hello World.

<p>I am Alexandre Viau, Debian Developper. This website covers my Debian-related work. I don't have much time to spend on a website, so that will have to do for now.

<p>The source for this website is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aviau/people.debian.org">aviau/people.debian.org</a>. I use scripts to generate it from jinja templates.
