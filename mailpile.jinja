<h1>Debian packaging for Mailpile</h1>

<p> I am the maintainer for Mailpile in Debian. The purpose of this page is to allow people to test the Mailpile packages before I upload them to Debian. It can also be useful for those that want new versions faster. The packages are signed with my GPG key, which is available in the Debian keyring.

<p> <b>Note:</b> The packages should be compatible for Ubuntu. Mailpile has very few dependencies and the packaging currently embeds the javascript, so there is low risk of incompatibilities.

<h2>Installing the repository</h2>
<pre>
apt-key adv --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv 3CCC3A3A
echo 'deb https://people.debian.org/~aviau/debian mailpile/' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mailpile.list
</pre>

<h2>Installing Mailpile</h2>
<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install mailpile-server
</pre>

Enjoy!
